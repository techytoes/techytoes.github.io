      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an Open Source Evangelist. Iâ€™m insanely passionate about computer programming, currently trying my hand in a number of fields, ranging from web development to competitive programming to Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed my Google Summer of Code project under organization Sofa-Framework in 2018. Some open source projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with include Sofa-Framework, Sympy, Rspamd and coala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to adapt to the changes and follow the latest technology trends. I love to hack on Deep learning and Neural Networks, have built a few interesting projects at hackathons. I love attending hackathons, regionals as well as nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
